# D.H.R.F.P - Demographics at Higher Risk from Future Pandemics
The project analysis aims to provide the best classification models and predictors so as to correctly predict the future demographics that are at the highest risk of 
being impacted from a future virus strain similar to COVID (Airborne transmission). The main intention is to identify the counties in US that are at a higher risk from 
airborne transmission of virus and help them prepare beforehand for such situations.

The data source is taken from Kaggle repository (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnjdavisiv/us-counties-covid19-weather-sociohealth-data)

This was done as a part of Masters Project.
